### Tools :

   - Excel - Data Cleaning
   - SQL Server - Data Analysis
   - Power BI - Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data Preparation phase, we performed the following tasks : 
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

EDA involved exploring the data to answer key question, such as:

- How many total bookings were made within the selected date range?
- What is the trend of ride volume over time (daily, weekly, or monthly)?
- What percentage of bookings were successful versus canceled?
- Which vehicle type is the most popular among users?
- How does the performance (bookings and revenue) of each vehicle type compare?
- What is the total revenue generated during the selected period?
- Which time of day or week contributes the most to revenue?
- How does revenue vary across vehicle types?
- What are the main reasons for ride cancellations (driver vs. customer vs. technical)?
- Are there any patterns in cancellations by day or vehicle type?
- What is the average customer rating for rides in the selected period?
- Are there specific times or vehicle types associated with lower ratings?
- What percentage of rides received 5-star ratings?
